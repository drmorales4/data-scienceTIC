Everyone says Neural Networks are ""black boxes"", but that's not true at all. In this video I break each piece down and show how it works, step-by-step, using simple mathematics that is still true to the algorithm. By the end of this video you will have a deep understanding of what Neural Networks do.

Julia - https://julialang.org/downloads/ 

GNU Octave - https://octave.org/download 

Scilab - https://www.scilab.org/download/scilab-6.1.1 

Well, Matlab is not open-source; it is a proprietary tool. Now the question is, what is the proprietary tool? 

Proprietary software is owned by an organization or an individual and is not ""public-domain software"" that can be freely distributed.

Julia - Julia a dynamically typed programming language with built-in parallel computing elements and functions for matrix manipulation, data visualization, and much more. Julia's syntax and capabilities are popular for a variety of reasons. For example, it has a feature that allows you to apply a function to one or more arrays without creating a complex loop.

Octave - Octave is the most well-known alternative to MATLAB. Octave has been in active development for nearly three decades and runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac. If you're Searching for a project that is as close to the existing MATLAB language as possible, Octave may be a good fit. 

Scilab - An open-source numerical computing option that runs on all major platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Scilab is the most well-known alternative, and its implementation is very similar to MATLAB. However, it is not a precise tool for project developers.
You can install Scilab by using the link below in the description.

02:06 Control statements
09:55 Matlab Loops
21:29 Try-catch Statements 
23:01 Arrays in Matlab 
28:11 Basic Programs in Matlab 

⏩The shortcuts of Matlab 
Clc - used to clear the command window 
Clear - used to remove the workspace 
Diary - here a copy of all inputs and most of the outputs typed in the command window will be echoed in the diary file.
Along with these, we have diary off-  It suspends input into the diary file. And diary on - It resumes input again.
Which -   It tells which version of a file is being executed and where it is located.

⏩A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. 
Generally, there are two types of looping, 
First, For loop - A for loop is used to repeat a statement or a group of statements a fixed number of times.
And the second one is a while loop. A while loop is used to execute a statement or a group of statements an infinite number of times until the conditional specified by while is false. 

⏩The break statement terminates the execution of a for loop or while loop.

⏩The continue statement works within a for or while loop and passes control to the next iteration.

This video is based on the *Top 10 dying programming languages in 2023* , which will inform you about the top 10 programming languages that will be outdated in 2023. If you are planning to upskill yourself and improve your programming skills, then this video will help you understand the programming languages to avoid in 2023. 

Here is the list of *Top 10 Dying Programming Languages 2023*
🔴 00:00 *Top 10 Dying Programming Languages 2023*
🔴 01:02 *CoffeeScript*
*CoffeeScript* is one of the lightest languages ever designed. CoffeeScript was adopted by major companies like dropbox, GitHub, etc to develop their browser-side code. JavaScript is a better alternative; in past years CoffeeScript was declared obsolete.

🔴 01:36 *Ruby*
*Ruby* is extensively used in building web applications, data processing, automation and many more. Python being strong competitor in terms of readablility and code security than Ruby, Ruby slowly became obsolete and is in the list of dying programming languages

🔴 02:16 *VBA*
*VBA* was one of the most extensively used programming languages. Despite being based on .NET, it is no longer updated by Microsoft, indicating its obsolescence.

🔴 02:55 *Scala*
*Scala* performance was not the issue however, most developers were unaware of features of Scala. Thereby, adding it in the list of dying programming languages

🔴 03:27 *Objective C*
Verbose nature, complex syntax, and outdated libraries of *Objective C*, made developers switch to swift for the ease of code readability and application development, thus adding it to the list of dying programming languages

🔴 04:06 *Perl* 
It is one of the most efficient open-source languages for text manipulation. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, *Perl* comes with a major drawback. Perl fails to support portability because of CPAN modules. Programs run slowly and must be interpreted each time any changes are made. 

🔴 04:45 *Haskell*
*Haskell* has faced issues like no proper IDE support, complex syntax, and a steep learning curve. This forced developers to migrate to better alternatives, thereby adding it into the list of dying programming languages.

*Top 3 Dying Programming Languages 2023*

🔴 05:26 *Fortran*
*Fortran* is in the list of dying programming languages because developers soon had to migrate to other languages due to a lack of dynamic memory, reliability, and unsafe code prone to cyber threats. 

🔴 06:05 *Erlang*
*Erlang* supported banking, e-commerce, computer systems development, and instant messaging services. Due to its complex debugging procedures and critical deployment issues it is not in use recent days.

🔴 06:41 *Cobol*
The early main frame programming for business transactions, banking, and many more was handled by *COBOL*. It had a tougher verbose syntax with slow compilation and deployment.

The most desirable country for international students that do not speak English is Germany. It is recognized for its top universities that provide students with affordable, high-quality education. Germany is home to dozens of world-class universities, as well as lively cities brimming with art galleries and exciting nightlife. German universities provide internationally renowned courses in law, computer science, medicine, engineering, and social science.

✅ Basic research on universities
You can begin the University research in advance by making a list of topics you are passionate about and look into occupations or study areas that are linked to those topics. You can also get in touch with former students from the German universities you're interested in which may give you a better understanding of the curriculum.

✅ University requirements
◼️ DSH examination: The test is designed to evaluate your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. The test is totally focused according to the classroom format, and as a result, the circumstances you might encounter while taking the course will be the basis for the questions.
◼️ TestDaF: TestDaF is a language exam for international German learners who want to study in Germany. The subjects are based on critical communication challenges in lectures, discussions, or working groups, as well as other university-related activities.
◼️ Goethe-Zertifikat C2: This exam includes modules for reading, listening, writing, and speaking. The four modules can be taken separately or together, with four different module certificates equal to a single all-round certificate.

✅ Apply for student Visa: Types of Visa’s
◼️ Prospective student visa: This visa is intended for students who have not yet received their university admissions decisions and are awaiting the outcomes of their final application processes. 
◼️ Student Visa: The student visa is intended for students who have already been accepted to a school in Germany. This visa is only valid for three months. During these three months, you must apply for your residence permit at your city's Foreigners' Registration Office.

✅ Enrolling at University
The enrollment confirmation document is known as a ""Immatrikulationsbescheinigung."" You'll need it in the future as it's a crucial document. The enrolling period is frequently very brief. A student ID will be sent to you once you have registered. Once you have received formal enrollment status, you are able to attend university classes

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speeds up the biochemical reactions. Enzymes acts on substrate to generate products. During this process enzyme will be not consumed.

Enzymes are highly specific and interacts with one or few substrates only.

Most of the enzymes are made up of proteins. Ribozyme is exception to this and it is made of RNA.

Enzyme reduces the activation energy required for a reaction there by increasing the speed of reaction.

Enzyme activity or velocity is the rate of enzyme catalysed reaction, generally it is expressed as mmoles of product formed per min/mg of enzyme.

Enzymes are biological catalysts, they speed up the biochemical reaction by reducing the activation energy.

The catalytic activity of many enzymes depends on the presence of small molecules called cofactors.
An enzyme without its cofactor is referred to as an apoenzyme; the complete, catalytically active enzyme is called a holoenzyme.
 
Cofactors can be subdivided into two groups:  
1. Metal Ions and 
2. Small organic molecules

The enzyme Taq DNA polymerase require Mg2+ for its activity, Lactate dehydrogenase requires small organic molecule Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

When bacteria cells are grown on a media containing glucose and lactose carbon sources, bacterial cells utilize glucose initially and grows exponentially. once the glucose is depleted, it prepares the system for utilization of lactose by producing enzymes required for metabolizing lactose. This is done by lac operon regulation. For this bacterial cells enters a second lag phase or the preparatory phase.

This type of growth curve is called as Diauxic growth curve or biphasic growth curve.

Genes for amino acid synthesis is clustered in operons. Trp operon regulates the biosynthesis of tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid, whose levels are controlled by trp operon.
Trp operon has operator, trp regulator, trp Leader sequence and five structural genes for the expression of enzymes required for the tryptophan synthesis
Tryptophan levels are regulated by 2 mechanisms:
1. Repressor mediated
2. Transcription attenuation mediated

Tryptophan biosynthesis regulation is based on repressor mediated and the fine tuning on the rate of synthesis is by transcription attenuation.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vEuZ-sQ5Cpo/hqdefault.jpg,Bio-Resource,,en-GB,PT11M36S
