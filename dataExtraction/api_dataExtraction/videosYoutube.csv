Everyone says Neural Networks are ""black boxes"", but that's not true at all. In this video I break each piece down and show how it works, step-by-step, using simple mathematics that is still true to the algorithm. By the end of this video you will have a deep understanding of what Neural Networks do.

This Matlab Programming video will go over the fundamental statements and functions that must be understood when writing a program in Matlab. In this video, we've also gone over some of the basic programs. I am sure that by the end of this video, you will be able to write programs in Matlab

In this video, we will cover
00:00 Matlab Programming
01:24 Environmental Programming 
02:06 Control statements
09:55 Matlab Loops
21:29 Try-catch Statements 
23:01 Arrays in Matlab 
28:11 Basic Programs in Matlab 

⏩The shortcuts of Matlab 
Clc - used to clear the command window 
Clear - used to remove the workspace 
Diary - here a copy of all inputs and most of the outputs typed in the command window will be echoed in the diary file.
Along with these, we have diary off-  It suspends input into the diary file. And diary on - It resumes input again.
Which -   It tells which version of a file is being executed and where it is located.

⏩A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. 
Generally, there are two types of looping, 
First, For loop - A for loop is used to repeat a statement or a group of statements a fixed number of times.
And the second one is a while loop. A while loop is used to execute a statement or a group of statements an infinite number of times until the conditional specified by while is false. 

⏩The break statement terminates the execution of a for loop or while loop.

⏩The continue statement works within a for or while loop and passes control to the next iteration.

7. SQL: SQL is a data language used to create data tables. It stores data, communicates with the database, and manipulates data to fetch the required results, a major part of data analytics.

6. TypeScript shares similarities with JavaScript but follows strict syntactical practices with brilliant tooling at any scale.

5. Swift: Swift was one of the oldest programming languages that needed programmers to be well aware of a large variety of libraries. Objective C was verbose and time-consuming to adapt.

4. C/C++: C is titled the mother of all programming languages. The veteran programming language has contributed a lot to developing new languages, compilers, databases, and one of the most popular operating systems, Microsoft Windows.

3. JavaScript: JavaScript. The most versatile and powerful programming language that turned the face of the internet. Javascript is a leading programming language with the highest number of communities and active users worldwide. 

2. Java: Java has the largest community, repositories, and support among all Programming languages. It has spread its roots into every software framework, mobile application, Big Data, and operating system; you name it, Java did it.

1. Python: Many believe that python is one of the newest programming languages. As a matter of fact, it’s a veteran programming language that is a lot older than Java.

That concludes our list of top programming languages for the year 2023.

*CoffeeScript* is one of the lightest languages ever designed. CoffeeScript was adopted by major companies like dropbox, GitHub, etc to develop their browser-side code. JavaScript is a better alternative; in past years CoffeeScript was declared obsolete.

🔴 01:36 *Ruby*
*Ruby* is extensively used in building web applications, data processing, automation and many more. Python being strong competitor in terms of readablility and code security than Ruby, Ruby slowly became obsolete and is in the list of dying programming languages

🔴 02:16 *VBA*
*VBA* was one of the most extensively used programming languages. Despite being based on .NET, it is no longer updated by Microsoft, indicating its obsolescence.

🔴 02:55 *Scala*
*Scala* performance was not the issue however, most developers were unaware of features of Scala. Thereby, adding it in the list of dying programming languages

🔴 03:27 *Objective C*
Verbose nature, complex syntax, and outdated libraries of *Objective C*, made developers switch to swift for the ease of code readability and application development, thus adding it to the list of dying programming languages

🔴 04:06 *Perl* 
It is one of the most efficient open-source languages for text manipulation. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, *Perl* comes with a major drawback. Perl fails to support portability because of CPAN modules. Programs run slowly and must be interpreted each time any changes are made. 

🔴 04:45 *Haskell*
*Haskell* has faced issues like no proper IDE support, complex syntax, and a steep learning curve. This forced developers to migrate to better alternatives, thereby adding it into the list of dying programming languages.

*Top 3 Dying Programming Languages 2023*

🔴 05:26 *Fortran*
*Fortran* is in the list of dying programming languages because developers soon had to migrate to other languages due to a lack of dynamic memory, reliability, and unsafe code prone to cyber threats. 

🔴 06:05 *Erlang*
*Erlang* supported banking, e-commerce, computer systems development, and instant messaging services. Due to its complex debugging procedures and critical deployment issues it is not in use recent days.

🔴 06:41 *Cobol*
The early main frame programming for business transactions, banking, and many more was handled by *COBOL*. It had a tougher verbose syntax with slow compilation and deployment.

2:27 University entrance qualifications

The most desirable country for international students that do not speak English is Germany. It is recognized for its top universities that provide students with affordable, high-quality education. Germany is home to dozens of world-class universities, as well as lively cities brimming with art galleries and exciting nightlife. German universities provide internationally renowned courses in law, computer science, medicine, engineering, and social science.

✅ Basic research on universities
You can begin the University research in advance by making a list of topics you are passionate about and look into occupations or study areas that are linked to those topics. You can also get in touch with former students from the German universities you're interested in which may give you a better understanding of the curriculum.

✅ University requirements
◼️ DSH examination: The test is designed to evaluate your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. The test is totally focused according to the classroom format, and as a result, the circumstances you might encounter while taking the course will be the basis for the questions.
◼️ TestDaF: TestDaF is a language exam for international German learners who want to study in Germany. The subjects are based on critical communication challenges in lectures, discussions, or working groups, as well as other university-related activities.
◼️ Goethe-Zertifikat C2: This exam includes modules for reading, listening, writing, and speaking. The four modules can be taken separately or together, with four different module certificates equal to a single all-round certificate.

✅ Apply for student Visa: Types of Visa’s
◼️ Prospective student visa: This visa is intended for students who have not yet received their university admissions decisions and are awaiting the outcomes of their final application processes. 
◼️ Student Visa: The student visa is intended for students who have already been accepted to a school in Germany. This visa is only valid for three months. During these three months, you must apply for your residence permit at your city's Foreigners' Registration Office.

✅ Enrolling at University
The enrollment confirmation document is known as a ""Immatrikulationsbescheinigung."" You'll need it in the future as it's a crucial document. The enrolling period is frequently very brief. A student ID will be sent to you once you have registered. Once you have received formal enrollment status, you are able to attend university classes

Enzymes are biological catalysts that speeds up the biochemical reactions. Enzymes acts on substrate to generate products. During this process enzyme will be not consumed.

Enzymes are highly specific and interacts with one or few substrates only.

Most of the enzymes are made up of proteins. Ribozyme is exception to this and it is made of RNA.

Enzyme reduces the activation energy required for a reaction there by increasing the speed of reaction.

Enzyme activity or velocity is the rate of enzyme catalysed reaction, generally it is expressed as mmoles of product formed per min/mg of enzyme.

Enzymes are biological catalysts, they speed up the biochemical reaction by reducing the activation energy.

The catalytic activity of many enzymes depends on the presence of small molecules called cofactors.
An enzyme without its cofactor is referred to as an apoenzyme; the complete, catalytically active enzyme is called a holoenzyme.
 
Cofactors can be subdivided into two groups:  
1. Metal Ions and 
2. Small organic molecules

The enzyme Taq DNA polymerase require Mg2+ for its activity, Lactate dehydrogenase requires small organic molecule Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

Genes for amino acid synthesis is clustered in operons. Trp operon regulates the biosynthesis of tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid, whose levels are controlled by trp operon.
Trp operon has operator, trp regulator, trp Leader sequence and five structural genes for the expression of enzymes required for the tryptophan synthesis
Tryptophan levels are regulated by 2 mechanisms:
1. Repressor mediated
2. Transcription attenuation mediated

Lac Operon: https://youtu.be/B5BFogztEQY

Operons are groups of genes clustered in the bacterial DNA regulating the expression of functionally related proteins.

 In E. coli half of the genes are clustered into operons which are involved in particular metabolic pathways.

Lac operon model was proposed by Jacob & Monad.

Lac Operon is responsible for the transport and metabolism of lactose.

cAMP mediated regulation of lac operon. adenylate cyclase converts ATP to cAMP which is inturn inhibited by high level of glucose.
